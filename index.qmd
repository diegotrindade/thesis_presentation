## Why is it hard to predict?

- Biodiversity is complex and scale dependent
- Temporal lags

## Dark diversity concept may help

- DD
- Traits
- Completeness

## Dark diversity estimation

- Co-occurrence

- Species that co-occur very often tend to share ecological similarities

## Dark diveristy over time or along gradients

- Figure cartoon

- Temporal datasets

- Space-for-time-substitution

## Biodiversity change and nature conservation



## Aims of this thesis

- Theoretical framework to examine biodiv change using dd

- Whether dark diversity can be used to understand temporal lags

- The role of dark diversity in nature conservation

## Main hypotheses

- Taxonomic and functional observed and dark diversity are expected to increase (local and pool gains) towards more benign conditions due to less stringent environmental filters and higher diversity of available niches 
 
- Over time, dark diversity is expected to depict species in expansion lags, because species appearing and persisting in dark diversity are considered suitable despite being absent for long periods of time.

- Traits related to low dispersal ability and high stress intolerance are expected to be found more often in dark diversity, and, thereby associated to species with delays in local colonization or establishment

- Dark diversity reveals species and traits threatened by regional extinction or that could be focused on restoration efforts. Community completeness provides insights on whether a site should
be restored (low community completeness) or conserved (high completeness)

# Discussion

## a

In this thesis, I advanced the role of dark diversity as a complementary and promising tool to examine biodiversity change by developing a conceptual framework in which species gains and losses are decomposed within the species pool (I); testing how much and how fast both taxonomic and functional species pool dynamics changed over time, due to climate change and human impact (II); and how dark diversity can be used to enhance nature conservation of species threatened by extinction, using lichens as a model (III).
